-double jump sequence "working"
-glitch with second jump
-attempted to rewrite conditions by considering the one cycle delay
 in updating ome signals-untested
-working well...need to make code more efficient
--------------
- moved sprites into separate package, also created type sprite_block
- wrote efficient code for multiple jumps. jumps are now unlimited though
- consider using two clocks, one for checking the button, another
  for animatingg the jump
- working
---------------
- two clocks implemented-- working
--------
- all working so far
-----------
- added air and duck sprites--done
- think about layering sprites, the black parts could cover the 
  sprite behind <-- solved by if statement
-------------
- used an if statement so it  only draws where the sprite element
  is non zero <--- working
- used 55 pixels sprites <-- working
-------------------
- pix55 constnat inside package ----- +
- alphanumeric sprites + separate package ----- +
- contact ----- / works once
- move hazard along x axis ----- +
- full clock divider ------ +
----------------------------------------
- contact: 
   - reset led contact_boolean to zero just before 
     drawing the trex ------ +
   - reset contact sprite to zero 
     right after drawing it. ------- +
-------------------------------------------
- need to make duck button make the trex to sprint to ground:
- ground added with animated kink ------- +
  jump_d <= jump_d - 20 at each clock cycle
